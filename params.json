Local curve matching may result in many ambiguous matches and hence a\r\nsearch technique is required to resolve the ambiguities for global reconstruction.The best-\frst strategy is one such\r\nsearch technique which selects and merges the best matching pair to form a new fragment. This is repeated until\r\nthere is only one fragment left which gives the recovered document.\r\n\r\nSince document fragments often have similar contour segments in real applications, invalid matching occurs\r\nfrequently using the local search strategies. Intensive backtracking in such cases makes these local search techniques\r\nine\u000Ecient. To overcome this, we resort to a global approach to disambiguate the candidate matches. The global consistency approach is based on the fact although some incorrect matches may score higher than the correct one locally, the global score of the correct con\fguration will be much higher than that of an invalid one. A globally consistent solution is found by exploiting the relationships among all candidate matches.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nAutomosaic was created by @srinivasans @raltgz @ma08 @\r\nThis project was placed 3rd (Bronze winning) in Inter hall OpenSoft contest 2014 conducted by [Technology Students Gymkhana](www.gymkhana.iitkgp.ernet.in/), [Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur](http://iitkgp.ac.in).\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with AutoMosaic ?
