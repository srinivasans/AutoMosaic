<p>Recovery of ripped-up documents is a problem that springs up in Archival study and Investigation science.
Ecient and successful joining of torn pieces of papers to reconstruct the original documents is an important and
challenging issue which if automated would alleviate the manual eort, which is dicult and time-consuming.
This paper focuses on the reconstruction of documents ripped up by hand.</p>

<p>Document reconstruction problems can be solved in two steps, nding an initial set of matching fragment pairs
as candidate matches followed by resolving the ambiguity among these candidate matches to reconstruct the
original document.Document fragments are represented by their contours and candidate matches are obtained by local curve
matching of individual fragments. Local curve matching may result in many ambiguous matches and hence a
search technique is required to resolve the ambiguities for global reconstruction.The best-rst strategy is one such
search technique which selects and merges the best matching pair to form a new fragment. This is repeated until
there is only one fragment left which gives the recovered document.</p>

<p>Since document fragments often have similar contour segments in real applications, invalid matching occurs
frequently using the local search strategies. Intensive backtracking in such cases makes these local search techniques
inecient. To overcome this, we resort to a global approach to disambiguate the candidate matches. The global consistency approach is based on the fact although some incorrect matches may score higher than the correct one locally, the global score of the correct conguration will be much higher than that of an invalid one. A globally consistent solution is found by exploiting the relationships among all candidate matches.</p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>
